This directory has some python scripts useful for testing the heater-shaker.

You'll need python 3.

To get setup, create a venv here and install requirements.txt:

```
virtualenv hs-venv
. ./hs-venv/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And then you can run the scripts. They should have argparse help and descriptions.
